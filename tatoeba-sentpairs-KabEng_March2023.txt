Today, March 8, is the feast of the woman, they say. It may be our grandmother, our mother, our sister, our daughter, even more so the one with whom we face life, whether we agree or not.

What we cannot fail to deplore are those who deliberately keep their daughters in coercion or worse, send their children to the slaughterhouse. Otherwise, how could we not have kind words to those who, alas, undergo the yoke, are deprived of everything, even die of hunger, are beaten, murdered and cut to pieces to be delivered to the jackals?

Our young women and men living under duress, those who do nothing but seek to lean on the shoulder of who does not have one, in the arms of companions whose property would have been granted by shameful procedures, baited as they were by futile charms and chimeras, all these must take their courage in both hands to seek a way out in order to come out of the deep darkness, by them themselves, whether they are men or women.
Yir zwaǧ tif-it tlelli deg tiɣɣubna d leḥṛis, imi igli d win wuɣur neţţazzal s wudem ara ɣ-igen tirigliwin d tigejda n usirem.	Freedom in need is much better than a poor marriage, since it is the horizon that we aim for head-on that can offer us the basic pillars of hope.
M'ur nfaq, m'ur faqent tura, ha-ţ-an timetti-nsent d tin-nneɣ, tameddurt-nneɣ irkulli, segmi i ţ-iɣunza, yefka-ţ weqjun i yiffis.	As long as we are not aware, they or all of us, our society, theirs, our whole life would be the one that the dogs, wanting no more, would offer to the hyenas.

Wid ur nceffu ɣef yizri, uẓren ad εawden ad t-idiren.	Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

It has often been said that the word "impossible" was not a French one. People have obviously looked in the wrong dictionary. In America, all is easy, all is simple and mechanical difficulties are overcome before they arise.

When the hour for departure drew near the old mother went to her bedroom, and taking a small knife she cut her fingers till they bled; then she held a white rag under them, and letting three drops of blood fall into it, she gave it to her daughter, and said: "Dear child, take great care of this rag: it may be of use to you on the journey."

And the hail destroyed through all the land of Egypt all things that were in the fields, both man and beast: and the hail smote every herb of the field, and it broke every tree of the country.
Yenna Musa : Akken kan ara ffɣeɣ i temdint, ad ḍeqleɣ i ɣallen-iw ɣer Rebbi, dɣa ad ḥebsen lerεuḍ yerna ur yettuɣal ad yili ubruri, iwakken ad teḥṣuḍ belli Lqaεa-ya n Rebbi.	Moses said: As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will stretch forth my hands to the Lord, and the thunders shall cease, and the hail shall be no more: that thou mayst know that the earth is the Lord's.
Maca ẓriɣ mazal ur tugadem ara Rebbi s kečč s yiqeddacen-ik.	But I know that neither thou, nor thy servants do yet fear the Lord God.
Ceyyeε ihi tura tesdukkleḍ-d taqeḍεit-ik d wayen akk tesεiḍ deg iger ; acku s yemdanen, s lmal, s wayen akk yellan deg berra, ma ur d-yennejmaε ara seg igran yerna iwet-d fell-as ubruri, atan ad yemmet.	Send therefore now presently, and gather together thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for men and beasts, and all things that shall be found abroad, and not gathered together out of the fields which the hail shall fall upon, shall die.

Thanks for understanding the drama of my homeland, which is, like Pablo Neruda would say, a silent Vietnam; there are no occupying troops, nor powerful planes clouding the clean skies of my land, but we're under financial blockade, we have no credit, we can't buy spare parts, we have no means to buy food and we need medicine...
